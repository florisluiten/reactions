# Requirements

This guide will help you with the requirements for running Reactions. Since
one of the requirements of the Challenge is not using any package, the
actual requirements are very minimal.

You must have PHP installed and running on your machine. The application
has been tested on 7.2 on a Ubuntu 18.04 machine; but should run equally
fine on any WinOS machine running a PHP version of 7.0 or above.
